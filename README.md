# VaccinationFinder
Auto crawl medical websites to get your Covid-19 vaccination appointment

1. Check the website of your preferred Doc. for online appointment tools.
2. Decide whether to use the request or the selenium version (selenium version might be more work but should be able to crawl every website. The request version needs the exact GET request to the medical appointment service.
3. Edit the example code to fit your needs. For the request version you might only need to swap out the URL. The Selenium version might need more work because you need to parse the html.
